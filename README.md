Hello, My name is Rishu Raj. I am from Bihar, India, and I specialise in backend and frontend development utilising React and Node.js (Express). I also have familiarity with Linux; I use it as both my workstation and my primary operating system. I also have experience in system administration and devops. I have extensive experience configuring systems, launching websites, installing and configuring web servers, and defending them against assaults. I've been working in a Game Server Hosting company since 2022. I'm currently learning Rust and using it to construct a few projects.

I am now studying for my 11th STD, and I am looking for an internship in system administration, application development, or infrastructure configuration. If you'd like to hire or interview me, please contact me at royadma0@gmail.com. I would also be happy to gain more knowledge through an internship at a company.

I appreciate you taking the time to read. Please consider mailing me if you would like more information about myself.
